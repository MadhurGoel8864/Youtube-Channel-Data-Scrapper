# Youtube Channel Data Scrapper 

Hello everyone, this project uses the concept of web scrapping.   
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.
It uses Selenium to use Chrome WebDriver to crawl the website.
I have taken Ashish Chanchalani's YouTube channel for example.
It first finds the title and video link of each video by crawling the main video page and storing it in a CSV file.
Then this file is used crawl to every video and find details like video title, likes, view count, upload date, video link, and description
