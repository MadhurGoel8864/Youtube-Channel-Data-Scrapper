# Youtube Channel Data Scrapper 

Hello everyone, this project uses the concept of web scrapping.   
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.
It uses Selanium to use chrome WebDriver to crawl the website.
I have taken Ashish Chanchalani Youtube Channel for example.
It first finds the title and video link of each video by crawling the main video page and stores it in a csv file.
Then this file is used crawl each and every video and find details like video title, likes, view count, upload date, video link and description
